A sports live score app built with React that gives you a live coverage (results, fixtures, standings) for almost all football leagues <i>(more sports are in the todo list, such as; basketball, valeyball, tennis, nfl etc..)</i>

Note: This app is still under construction and will continue to develop, and receive more features along the way. 


Credit: This project was initialize with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

<h6>A Live screencast is added below. It might just give you an idea about what the app might look like when it is 100% completed. </h6>

<b>-- Cautious: The UI is there, but most of the features you see in the screencast are not working right now (filtering, sport selection, favorites, date selection etc..). So, <i>to-do<i> list is very long ;) keep track!</b>
